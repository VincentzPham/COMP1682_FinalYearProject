**Harnessing Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Environmental Solutions**
Author: Pham Hoang Gia Khang

**Introduction**
This is my Final Project studying on Environment Problem, we apply Machine Learning algorithms to predict temperature, Green house gas and fossil fuel $\text{CO}_2$
1. Global Temperature: this [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET) is the link of dataset for Global Temperature.
2. Green House Gas: this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions) is the link of dataset for Green House Gas.
3. Fossil Fuels CO2 Emissions: this[Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation) is the link of dataset for Fossil Fuels CO2 Emissions.

In this project, I will work with data which is relevant with numerical numbers and Time Series Data. 

**How to run this project**
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install packages in requirements.txt
3. Just run this command in a terminal:
```bash
python MainAppRun.py
```
