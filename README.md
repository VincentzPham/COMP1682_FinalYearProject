## Introduction
This is my final project focusing on environmental problems. I apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to predict global temperature, greenhouse gas emissions, and CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels.

**Harnessing Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Environmental Solutions** aims to leverage advanced computational techniques to forecast key environmental indicators such as global temperature trends, greenhouse gas emissions, and CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels.

### Objectives

1. **Accurate Prediction:** Utilize ML and DL models to achieve high-accuracy predictions of environmental metrics.
2. **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyze historical data to uncover patterns and trends that can inform future environmental policies.
3. **Scalability:** Develop models that can be scaled and adapted to incorporate additional environmental variables and datasets.
4. **User-Friendly Application:** Create a user interface that allows stakeholders to interact with the models and visualize predictions effortlessly.

### Significance

The integration of ML and DL in environmental science offers the potential to revolutionize how we understand and address climate-related issues. Predictive models can forecast future scenarios based on current and historical data, enabling proactive measures rather than reactive responses. This project not only contributes to the academic field but also provides practical tools for real-world applications in environmental management and policy formulation.

By advancing the accuracy and reliability of environmental predictions, this project supports the global effort to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future.

## Datasets
1. **Global Temperature:** 
    - **Source:** Data sourced from [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET).
    - **Description:** Contains historical global temperature records spanning from 1961 to 2023.
    - **Key Features:** Monthly average temperatures, regional breakdowns, etc.

2. **Greenhouse Gas:** 
    - **Source:** Data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions).
    - **Description:** Contains historical Greenhouse Gas records spanning from 1990 to 2014.
    - **Key Features:** Yearly values, regional breakdowns, kind of GHG emissions, etc.

3. **Fossil Fuels CO₂ Emissions:** 
    - **Source:** Data sourced from [Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation).
    - **Description:** Contains historical Fossil Fuels CO2 Emissions records spanning from 1751 to 2014.
    - **Key Features:** Yearly values, regional breakdowns, kind of fossil fuels, etc.

In this project, I work with numerical and time series data relevant to environmental metrics.

## How to Run This Project
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    - **On Windows:**
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **On macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
3. **Install Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python MainAppRun.py
    ```
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and reliability of the data used for modeling. Below are the preprocessing steps tailored for each dataset.

### 1. Global Temperature
#### Handling Missing Values
In the Global Temperature dataset, some quarterly data points were missing. To address this, I computed the missing quarterly temperature (`x4`) by taking the average of the three corresponding monthly temperatures (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`). The formula used is:

$$
x4 = \frac{$x_1$ + $x_2$ + $x_3$}{3}
$$

**Where:**
- **$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$:** Temperatures for the individual months within the quarter.
- **$x_4$:** Average temperature for the quarter.

- **Normalization:** Applied Min-Max Scaling for feature normalization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Added time-based features like month, quarter, and year, and created lag features for target variables.

### 2. Greenhouse Gas
- **Normalization:** Used MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Partitioned data by year to capture annual trends.

### 3. Fossil Fuels CO₂ Emissions
- **Normalization:** Applied Min-Max Scaling for feature normalization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Partitioned data by year to focus on annual emission trends.

## Time Series Analysis
I implement the following Time Series Analysis approaches:
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- **Seasonal Decomposition**
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF Test)**
- **ACF/PACF Plots**

## Time Series Models
- **ARIMA:** Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
- **SARIMA:** Seasonal ARIMA.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** A method for smoothing time series data.

## Deep Learning Models
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** A type of neural network suited for sequential data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** An advanced RNN architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies.
